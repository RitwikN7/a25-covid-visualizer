Other notes or comments to the grader:

- To begin, select choose a country from the dropdown box in the top left corner of the GUI. 
- Then, if you would like to select a date range to display on the graph, choose two dates on the bottom and check the checkbox to the left of the date selection.
- If you would like to view data for a specific day for the selected country, choose a date from the date picker up top.
- To export data from the previous step to a txt file, click the "save data entry" button. This results in the file "data_output.txt"
- Our dataset only contains data after 1/22/2020
- screenshot_0.png is the what the application looks like when opening it
- screenshot_1.png is what the application looks like after choosing a country, displaying all available date
- screenshot_2.png is the what the application looks like after clicking on the top calendar function, displaying all data for a specific date
- screenshot_3.png is the what the application looks like when choosing 2 dates to view a graph for

 

We also have a screenshot function, that creates a file named, "snapshot.png" that is a screenshot of whatever the program is currently showing. 
At this time, this function does not work when running the program from the `executable.jar`, but it does work when running the program from an Eclipse project.
This is not our main data output functionality, this is the txt file previously mentioned; the screenshot feature is just an additional thing we did for fun.
